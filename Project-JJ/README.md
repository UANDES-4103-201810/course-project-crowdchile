# README
Juan Valdivieso and Juan Manuel Campos

We managed to complete almost all features, without implementing correct CSS.

The ones pending are:

The homepage doesnt show the best projects images
Facebook button is duplicated
It adds to wishlist twice
Sometimes it crashed because of pending information
Users do not acquire all information from their facebook profiles
The admin must be seeded at the start
The main projects must be seeded too
We cannot search for projects in a specific category, just search in all categories together.
